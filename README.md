# Decentralized git

# Concept

Git is by far the most widely used modern version control system today. It is used by a lot of developers around the world allowing them to keep track of their work and to share it with others. Github is one of the most popular application of git. Everyone can use it freely as long as they don't mind their code being public and avalaible to everyone to see. But there are some projects you don't want to share with everybody. If this is the case, it will cost money every month. What we want to develop is a platform like github but decentralized allowing anyone to store the source code on decentralized cloud storage. All the computations that are needed to update the code will be done on iExec. The use of the blockchain will mean more security concerning who has the rights to see the source code. The other advantage of this decentralized git is that the user will pay each time he has to use the versionning control but not when he doesn't use it.

# Process

For the user, the process will be similar to what he is used to do with github. We will provide a cli allowing him to do all the operations possible with git. The work will then be submitted to iExec that would do the task and then store the result on the decentralized cloud storage of the user.

# Roadmap

+ V1 : March
In the first version, we aim to have the primary functions of git done so the users could start using this decentralized git with the cli. Versionning control systems are really complex so there will be a big part of research to begin with.

+ V2 : April
In the second version, we want to give the user the ability to share the source code permissions to anyone he wants. In parallel we will develop a user interface to give a more user friendly experience.
